    title: Speed from Odometer Count vs Odometer RevTime?
    teaser: These plots show how the ground speed differs depending on whether it is derived from the Odometer Count field (current method) or             the Odometer RevTime field which appears to be more reliable as the former has some spikes introduced through the was it is processed. <br>                 Links to the individual test runs can be found below the image
